# UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Modal Cursor Routing Issue ✅

**Problem:** Multiple close buttons (X signs) in the login modal were causing cursor routing issues.

**Root Cause:** The LoginModal component had two close buttons:
- One manually added in the DialogHeader
- One automatically added by the DialogContent component from Radix UI

**Solution:** 
- Hidden the default close button using `[&>button]:hidden` class
- Repositioned the custom close button with proper z-index
- Ensured only one close button is interactive

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/LoginModal.tsx` - Lines around 158-170

### 2. Header Button Visibility Issues ✅

**Problem:** Top header buttons were getting hidden or overlapped on different device sizes.

**Root Causes:**
- Buttons didn't have `flex-shrink: 0` causing them to compress
- Insufficient spacing between elements
- Header height wasn't consistent across devices
- Language dropdown was too narrow on tablets

**Solutions:**
- Added `flex-shrink-0` class to all header buttons and containers
- Improved responsive sizing with device-specific min-widths
- Enhanced header structure with consistent height (64px mobile, 72px desktop)
- Better gap management between header elements
- Added proper CSS rules for different screen sizes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Header.tsx` - Multiple lines around 100-650
- `src/styles/accessibility.css` - Added responsive CSS rules

### 3. Responsive Design Compatibility ✅

**Comprehensive responsive fixes added:**
- **Mobile (< 768px):** Reduced padding, ensured mobile menu visibility
- **Tablet (768px - 1023px):** Adjusted button sizing, optimized spacing
- **Desktop (> 1024px):** Full feature display with proper container width
- Added smooth transitions and prevented layout shift
- Improved backdrop blur support with proper vendor prefixes
